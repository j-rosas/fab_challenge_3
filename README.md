## Design and make an “ethical tool or artifact” that allows you interact with others

### Concept of the Project 

For this challenge, we are exploring how sound affects humans decisions. 

Based on design ethics, we started discussing about the non-neutrality of design, boundaries between technology and design, how design choices influence the functionality of society and the re-creation of reality.

Our common areas of interest are music, games, communication and low tech with the purpose of seeking new ways of relationship between humans and non-humans.  By this, we are developing an artifact that allows human interaction, guided by different sounds, creating a final output. The human interaction (input) is about drawing and trying "connecting the dots" with a marker. The final output is the drawing itself.

### Planification
(team planning)
### Execution
(fabrication process and materials)
### System Diagram 
(ilustration explaining function, parts and relations)
### Integrated Design 
(how you design it, files )
### Honest Design
(use of tech in a meaningful way)
### Iteration process
(prototypes,solving problems with creativity, explore design boundaries final result)
### Future Development Oportunities
(beyond)
